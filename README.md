An R package to facilitate searching and downloading data from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF).

## Dependencies
RESGF requires that you have a version of wget available in your path.

## Installation

You can install this package directly from the GitHub repository using the following command:

```{R}
devtools::install_github("ThePayneLab/RESGF")
```

## An example

How to search a dataset.

```{R}
resgf_search_datasets(variable_id=c("tos","so"),
                      experiment_id="historical",
                      table_id="Omon",
                      project="CMIP6")
```


## More help

Examples and documentation are still a little thin as yet - if you're serious about using this, I suggest getting in contact directly. Questions, queries, comments or theories are always welcome via the GitHub repository. Push-requests are especially welcome!

## Tips and Tricks for Working with ESGF 

* Not all data nodes on the ESGF are equal. If you are having trouble getting getting a particular file, search for replicas of it first, and then trying downloading it from a different data node (see the data_node column of the `resgFileset` object). You'll quickly learn that some nodes are more equal than others.
