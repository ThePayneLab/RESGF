# RESGF (development version)

* `resgf_search()` results are now simplifed where possible to remove unnecessary lists
* Previous funtionality to work directly with wget scripts and their manifests removed. Instead we focus on using search results as the
  basis for retrieval.
* Print methods for `resgf_*` objects now accept `n=...` argument

# RESGF 0.1.0

* First feature complete draft, with basic documentation
