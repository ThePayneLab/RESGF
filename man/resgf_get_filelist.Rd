\item{max.datasets}{maximum number of datasets to request in a chunk}

\item{processes}{Number of processes to perform in parallel}

Gets the list of files associated with the datasets. This is done in a piecewise manner to avoid
overloading both the number of return values and the ability to issue the command, and can optionally
be done in parallel as well.
