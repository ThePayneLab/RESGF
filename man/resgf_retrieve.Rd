\description{
Retrieve missing files from ESGF
}
\details{
When a resgfStatus object is supplied, only files that are not held locally or that have failed checksum checks 
(if performed)are retrieved. For a resgfFileset object, all files are retrieved.

The download scripts are always written to local.dir with the extension *.sh. If run in parallel, 
log files are also written to the local.dir with the extension .sh.log. Normally these are deleted upon a successful 
completion, but they can be retained using the keep.tempfiles argument.
